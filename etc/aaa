# Keying Material Exporter [RFC-5705]

# Label values beginning with "EXPERIMENTAL" MAY be used for private use 
# without registration.  Note that exporter labels have the potential to
# collide with existing PRF labels.  In order to prevent this, labels
# SHOULD begin with "EXPORTER".  This is not a MUST because there are
# existing uses that have labels which do not begin with this prefix.

# The output is a pseudorandom bit string of length bytes generated from the 
# master_secret.  

KeyingMaterialExporter.Context "OpenAAA"
KeyingMaterialExporter.Label   "EXPORTER_AAA"
KeyingMaterialExporter.Length  "8"
